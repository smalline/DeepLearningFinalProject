Higher BLEU score indicates that the generated captions are very similar to those of the actual caption present on the images.\n","* The validation loss falls upto 5th epoch and then increases afterwards, while the training loss still continues falling.\n","\n","\n","* The following were the major outcomes and a observations of the training process and testing the model on the test data:\n","\n","* The validation loss increases after 5th epoch in most cases even though the training loss decreases over time. This indicates that the model is over fitting and the training needs to stop.\n","* Higher BLEU score doesn't aways translate to better generated captions. If the model overfits on your training data, it will lead the model to go through details in the image and generate out captions which don't make sense. it can be seen in the strong and the weak captions generated above."],"metadata":{"id":"_jAre9FB5HzG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"Sw2z7B5n4-_3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
